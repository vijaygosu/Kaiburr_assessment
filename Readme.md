# **Consumer Complaint Classification (Task 5\)**

This project addresses Task 5 of the Kaiburr technical assessment. The goal is to perform text classification on the Consumer Complaint Database to categorize consumer complaints into one of four predefined financial product categories.

The entire process follows the steps outlined in the task description, including data analysis, text preprocessing, model training, performance comparison, and final prediction.

## **1\. Requirements and Installation**

This project is built using Python 3 and several common data science libraries.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x  
* pip (Python package installer)

### **Installation**

To run this script, you first need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk

Additionally, the script will automatically download the necessary NLTK data (stopwords and wordnet) on its first run if they are not found.

## **2\. Dataset**

The dataset used is the **Consumer Complaint Database** provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

* **Source:** [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database)  
* **Local File:** The script is configured to load the data from a local file named complaints.csv placed in the same directory.

The model is trained on the Consumer complaint narrative column to predict the Product category.

## **3\. How to Run the Script**

1. **Place the dataset:** Make sure the complaints.csv file is in the same folder as the Python script.  
2. **Execute the script:** Run the script from your terminal using the following command:  
   python original\_complaint\_classifier.py

3. **View the output:** The script will print the results of the analysis, model training, and evaluation directly to the console.

## **4\. Methodology**

The project follows the six steps specified in the task description:

1. **Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**  
   * The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.  
   * It is filtered to keep only the four target product categories.  
   * Rows with missing complaint narratives are dropped.  
   * A numerical label is created for each product category.  
2. **Text Pre-Processing:**  
   * A custom function cleans each complaint narrative by:  
     * Converting text to lowercase.  
     * Removing punctuation and numbers.  
     * Tokenizing the text.  
     * Removing common English stopwords.  
     * Applying lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.  
3. **Selection of Multi-Classification Models:**  
   * Three robust baseline models were selected for comparison:  
     * **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** A fast and effective model for text classification.  
     * **Logistic Regression:** A reliable linear model that performs well on text data.  
     * **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful classifier often considered a top performer for text.  
4. **Comparison of Model Performance & 5\. Model Evaluation:**  
   * The data is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.  
   * A scikit-learn Pipeline is used to chain the TfidfVectorizer (for converting text to numerical features) and the classifier.  
   * Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.  
   * Performance is measured using a **Classification Report** (providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class) and a **Confusion Matrix**.  
5. **Prediction:**  
   * The best-performing model (based on the weighted F1-score) is automatically selected.  
   * This model is then used to predict the category of a new, unseen sample complaint to demonstrate its practical application.

New Complaint Text:  
'I am writing to dispute a charge on my mortgage account.  
My bank, Acme Bank, has incorrectly charged me a late fee,  
but I sent the payment well before the due date. I have bank  
records to prove it. This has negatively affected my credit score.'
